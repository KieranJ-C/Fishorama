/* LERNING PILL: XNAMachinationisRatio Engine
 * XNAMachinationisRatio is an engine that allows implementing
 * simulations and games based on XNA, simplifying the use of XNA
 * and adding features not directly available in XNA.
 * XNAMachinationisRatio is a work in progress.
 * The engine works "under the hood", taking care of many features
 * of an interactive simulation automatically, thus minimizing
 * the amount of code that developers have to write.
 * 
 * In order to use the engine, the application main class (Kernel, in the
 * case of FishO'Rama) creates, initializes and stores
 * an instance of class Engine in one of its data members.
 * 
 * The classes comprised in the  XNA Machinationis Ratio engine and the
 * related functionalities can be accessed from any of your XNA project
 * source code files by adding appropriate 'using' statements at the beginning of
 * the file.

    /* LEARNING PILL: Token behaviors in the XNA Machinationis Ratio engine
     * Some simulation tokens may need to enact specific behaviors in order to
     * participate in the simulation. The XNA Machinationis Ratio engine
     * allows a token to enact a behavior by associating an artificial intelligence
     * mind to it. Mind objects are created from subclasses of the class AIPlayer
     * included in the engine. In order to associate a mind to a token, a new
     * mind object must be created, passing to the constructor of the mind a reference
     * of the object that must be associated with the mind. This must be done in
     * the DefaultProperties method of the token.
     * 
     * Hence, every time a new tipe of AI mind is required, a new class derived from
     * AIPlayer must be created, and an instance of it must be associated to the
     * token classes that need it.
     * 
     * Mind objects enact behaviors through the method Update (see below for further details).
